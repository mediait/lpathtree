## lpathtree module

This module is just fork of original PostgreSQL *ltree* written by Teodor Sigaev (teodor@sigaev.ru) and Oleg Bartunov (oleg@sai.msu.su)

This version is using `/` instead of `.` as label separator.
And it allows to have special characters like `{ } ! *` in lpathtree labels by dropping ability for full-text search queries over pathes (`ltxtquery`).
